This project is a tower defense developed as a project for our university, where we use two algorithm: dijkstra and breadth first.

How it's used?
    We based our game in another project, from x github where the other programmer uses A* as the main algorithm for navigating the enemies, here we are making something diferent, we are trying to show how the different algorithms react in the same situation
